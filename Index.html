End‑User License Agreement (EULA)

1. BlackBird Studios grants you a personal, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to use History Experience: Alhambra for private, non‑commercial purposes only.

2. All title, ownership, and intellectual property rights in and to the game (including code, graphics, audio, interface, and any content) are retained by BlackBird Studios. You are licensed to use the game — you do not own it.

3. You may not use the game for commercial exploitation (e.g., ticketing, public VR venues, rentals, paid exhibitions) without prior written permission from BlackBird Studios. You may not distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, or transfer the game to third parties. You may not reverse‑engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code or internal structure of the game. Nor may you bypass or disable any technological protection measures (such as DRM).

4. Use of the game by museums or cultural institutions is only permitted if a prior written agreement is signed with BlackBird Studios. Such an agreement may include an institutional license, fees, and control mechanisms (e.g., DRM, license audits).

5. You are permitted to make one backup copy for your personal use, provided that you do not share it or use it for commercial purposes.

6. BlackBird Studios may provide updates, patches, or enhancements to the game, and such updates are also governed by this license.

7. You acknowledge that the game may be subject to international export control laws. You agree not to export, re‑export, or otherwise make the game available to any person, entity, or country prohibited by such laws, unless you have obtained all required authorizations.

8. If you breach any of these terms, BlackBird Studios may revoke your license. Upon termination, you must uninstall the game and delete all copies in your possession.

9. This Agreement is governed by the laws designated by BlackBird Studios for its global operations. Any dispute arising from or relating to this EULA shall be resolved through international arbitration or another agreed‑upon dispute‑resolution mechanism.
